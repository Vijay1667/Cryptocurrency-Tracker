1. Login: I have used firebase authentication which uses gmail login, it is secure and google makes sure of it,
2. API: I have used wazirx free API for retriving the data.

I have used express js as backend, I have made sure that API is not leaked on the frontend side. All requests are made to backend and from the backend to wazirx API
